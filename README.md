# osuDensityCalculator

Inefficient osu!std hitobject density calculator class library for detecting stream maps.
Can be used in CarouselBeatmap for filtering and OsuBeatmap for displaying the value. 

My own algorithm for detecting stream maps.
Takes some time to generate cached value on first launch, then works like a charm.
